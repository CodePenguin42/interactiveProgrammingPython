#notes from lectures - more on Lists
#when copying the value of a tuple use list e.g. list(tuple); to create a mutable list
#list.append(n), list.pop(n), list.index(n), remove(n)
#pop removes the selected element fromt he list and returns it
#BUT len(list)
#in can match numbers or whole strings
#if x in list - returns t/f
#for x in list: action - performs the action for every x in list
#cannot remove from a list that you are iterating over, you have to create a separate list of stuff to remove, then if there is stuff in it remove those things from the origional list
#OR build a new list of the things you want to keep
#can store multiple pieces of data about an object in a list e.g ball = [1,2,"green"]; x,y,colour
#build something that works, test it, change it a little, test, change etc.
#boolean flags, keep track if something has happened or not
